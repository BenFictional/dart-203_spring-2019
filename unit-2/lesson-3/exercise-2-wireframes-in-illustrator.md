Objectives

* Compose the basic layout of a one-page website using 2D design software.
* Prepare text and image assets for use in the final design.
* Consider user experience and responsive design from the first stages of design.

Throughout this course we will use Illustrator to outline and develop our websites. This is common practice among design firms and freelancers, so let's get the terminology straight before we begin.

### Wireframes

Wireframes are the most basic version of a layout. After creating a mood board for inspiration, this is where you start pull your idea out the ether and make it real. At this stage your design will have no color or custom fonts, and the exact dimensions of content sections will probably change later on down the road.

The goal here is to figure out how the content will be arranged, and roughly how much space the elements will occupy in you design. You should think about how a user will interact with the site, what is the most important thing for them to see first? What might be confusing? How can be create an engaging narrative as users travel one one section of the site to another?

Wireframes can even be done in a sketchbook, but we'll use Illustrator to keep everything neat and legible. Digital design also allow you to easily resize and rearrange elements. 

### Mockups

Taking the wireframe to the next level, the mockup adds colors, fonts, and graphics to create a lifelike replica of the final website. It's good to get dimensions and sizing as close as possible to the final product, but certainly you want a 2D image that you can show to people to convey what the final site will look like. If you're working with a separate web developer, this might be as far as the designer goes in the process, as they hand of their mockup as a reference image.

### Prototypes

Both wireframes and mockups can be made into interactive prototypes, where you can actually click on things to simulate the final user experience. We'll talk more about prototypes in Unit 3â€”for now, we will be making static 2D graphics in Illustrator.
