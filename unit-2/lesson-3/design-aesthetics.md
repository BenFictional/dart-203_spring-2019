The word "aesthetics" gets used a lot in art and design. From it's Greek origins \("sensitive, sentient, pertaining to sense perception"\) to contemporary academia, aesthetics can describe any number of media and creative endeavors. But we're here to make websites. 

If you haven't taken a lot of art and design courses, you might get some of the following words mixed up \(they are awfully vague\), so let's review some definitions: 

* Aesthetics — The branch of philosophy describing beauty and perception 
* Aesthetic — A set of principles defining beauty, according to a particular person or culture \(e.g. "steampunk"\)
* Style — A particular appearance or character. \(e.g. "cartoonish"\) 
* Genre — A class or category of artistic work. \(e.g. "noir"\)
* Mood — A distinctive emotional character \(e.g. "mysterious"\)

These words are sometimes used interchangeably to describe to overall appearance of a piece of art or design, but you understand how each one relates to a given work. 

Web design shares many visual styles and motifs with graphic design and related fields, and at any moment, there are a variety of different aesthetics in use online, and designers may wish to establish different moods depending on the content of a website. 

When creating your designs, it's good to consider what visual cues make sense with your content. For example a website for a homemade furniture company might have a rustic appearance with images of wood grain and blocky typography—but that style of website would feel totally out of place if applied to a virtual reality startup. 

While there are individual considerations for any site, there are also overarching trends and agreements about "what looks good" in modern web design. These trends change over time; for example, over the past ten years websites and apps have transitions from realistic [skeuomorphism](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/skeuomorphism-is-dead-long-live-skeuomorphism) to [flat design.](http://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/what-flat-design-3132112)

The following Lynda course focuses on the aesthetics of contemporary web design. We'll discuss a lot of these concepts throughout the course, and during peer reviews, but if you think that you don't have a good "design sense" or want to see how to create designs with a contemporary aesthetic, these videos will be very useful.

Of course, the best way to develop your own aesthetic taste is with practice and critical examination. Designers often make choices based on gut instincts—or rather their eye's instincts—so don't be afraid to ignore some of the rules outlined in the Lynda course and just do whatever you think looks good.
