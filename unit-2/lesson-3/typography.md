Unit 1 included an introduction to creative typography, but as we continue to work with text, we need to think about typography as a functional tool as well as an aesthetic object. Because many websites contain long passages of text, it will be helpful to look at some of the traditional rules of typography.

Like any design "rules," these guidelines about typography should be remembered as traditions, and not fixed rules. If you think breaking some of these guidelines will improve your design, feel free! 

The benefits of these rules are that they are what people are used to seeing in professional design. By utilizing separate styles for **header text **and **body text**, a reader can quickly identify the important information and more quickly skim the content. As you know from HTML, you can have up to six header styles, which create a visual **hierarchy** of organization; in other words, they help readers identify where sections of content begin and end. Headers also help **search engine optimization \(SEO\)** because ranking algorithms like Google's use headers to identify the main subjects of a website. 

### Font Pairing

Web designers typically create this distinction of header and body text by using different fonts for headers and body text. **Font Pairing** is the art of choosing two fonts that look good together. You can use more than two fonts if it seems useful, but if you have more than 3-4 your design will appear unorganized and chaotic. 

Let's look at the main three families of fonts:![](/assets/lesson-2/font-families.png)

Serifs are the small "feet" included at the top and bottom of individual characters; they are designed to help guide a reader's eye along a line of text; for this reason they are more commonly used for body text. As an example, consider almost every printed book you've ever read. Serif fonts generally make text feel more traditional and old-fashioned. 

Sans-serif fonts \(literally "without serifs"\) appear more modern and are typically used as headers. 

Monospace fonts derive from typewriters—where each character had to be the same width—and are mostly used in coding environments like Terminal or Brackets. Traditionally you wouldn't use these fonts for body text, but many designers will sacrifice readability for a typewriter or computer-y aesthetic. 

When beginning a project, it's helpful to choose two fonts as a basis for your headers and body text. You can always add additional fonts if needed, but see what you can do just by varying the size and color of your two starting fonts. 

#### You can use any combination of serif and sans-serif fonts! Don't feel limited by the tradition of sans-serif headers and serif body text. 

Ian Yates' [A Beginner's Guide to Font Pairing](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-pairing-fonts--webdesign-5706) is a great crash course in the issue. To highlight one idea from his article, consider whether your fonts are **concordant** \(i.e. similar\) or **contrasting** \(i.e. different\). Fancy type vocabulary... yeesh.

The fonts on the left are Droid Serif and Droid Sans, which were designed to be used as a pair and are very similar.

The fonts on the right are Bebas Neue \(a condensed—i.e. tall and narrow— sans-serif font\) and Alex Brush \(a handwriting font\), and are visaully very different. This combination has a lot more energy, because of the dramatic contrast between the fonts, but such a pairing might not be appropriate for some types of content \(say, a hospital\).
