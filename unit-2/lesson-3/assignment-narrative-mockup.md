For this assignment, students will create a graphic mockup of a single-page website that we will develop in Lesson 4.

### Objectives

* Use professional imaging software to compose a detailed rendering of a web layout.
* Plan the arrangement and functionality of various content elements. 
* Consider flexible layout in mobile and desktop contexts.



### Mockups

Mockups are an essential part of building websites and apps. In some cases a developer may begin a project by building a functional "skeleton" of a site \(often to test the functionality of programmatic elements\) but usually a product is first established as a non-functional mockup—a picture of the final product.

As a designer, it's valuable to have development skill to build functional prototypes, but even when adopting the role of a developer/designer, many would choose to begin with a mockup. Once the mockup has been created it can be recreated exactly as a functioning website, or, depending on the project, the design may change during the development process.

A good mockup should look like a real website, and include details like navigation menus, text, and icons.

**Your finished mockup should include two images:**

* A mobile layout  \(640px wide\)
* A desktop layout \(1280px wide\)

The height of each layout will be determined by the content of your particular project.

### Instructions

You can use the Lynda course [Illustrator for Web Design](https://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/Welcome/108130/109803-4.html?srchtrk=index%3a1
linktypeid%3a2
q%3aillustrator+web+design
page%3a1
s%3arelevance
sa%3atrue
producttypeid%3a2) to guide you through the process.

#### **Step 1: Create a document**

When creating a new Illustrator document, choose the preset Mobile &gt;&gt;&gt; iPhone 5/5s \(640px x 1136px\).

Newer phones aren't quite that small, but it's good to design around the smallest size you might encounter.

#### Step 2: Set up artboards

Create a second artboard by following the instruction in the Lynda video [Using Artboards for Responsive Design ](https://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/Using-artboards-responsive-layouts/108130/109812-4.html?srchtrk=index%3a1
linktypeid%3a2
q%3aillustrator+web+design
page%3a1
s%3arelevance
sa%3atrue
producttypeid%3a2)\(from the same course above\). We're not going to bother with a tablet layout for this assignment, so you should only have two artboards. Make your second artboard 1280px x 2000px as seen in the video, and then change the height of your artboards as needed for your project.

#### Step 3: Set up colors

If you created your color palette with Adobe Color, you can access the color directly through Illustrator's Libraries window. Lynda offers a walkthrough of that process in [Using Adobe Color in Illustrator CC](https://www.lynda.com/Color-tutorials/Using-Adobe-Color-Illustrator-CC/439424/475382-4.html).

Otherwise, you can just copy and paste the hex-codes to create some generic shapes with your color palette, and then [create swatches of those colors ](https://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/Creating-custom-swatches/108130/109819-4.html?srchtrk=index%3a1

#### Step 4: Set up fonts

You should _absolutely_ look beyond the standard [web-safe fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp) for this assignment. Your narrative website should look professional and original, and that means using custom fonts. There are a few different ways to implement custom fonts, but since we're going to be developing our narrative websites in Adobe Muse, it will be easiest to choose custom fonts from the  Adobe Typekit library.

Adobe Typekit can be access through individual adobe apps \(usually in the text character window\), or through the Creative Cloud app, or through a web browser. [Here are instructions for all three methods](https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/help/add-fonts-typekit.html).

Essentially this allows you to choose form thousands of custom fonts, including many from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

One approach is to create some placeholder text outside of your document's artboards to get a feel for how your fonts look, and you can adjust the relative size of headers and body text. That way you can quickly use the Eyedropper tool \(I\) to apply those styles to new text in your project.

It's helpful to use **filler text** as a placeholder for actual content when designing a mockup. The traditional text is a latin passage from _The Extremes of Good and Evil_ by Cicero \(45 BCE\), known as **Lorem Ipsum**—[get the text here](http://www.lipsum.com/).

There are also a bevy of contemporary spins on Lorem Ipsum, such as [Hipster Ipsum,](https://hipsum.co/?paras=4&type=hipster-centric) [Corporate Ipsum](http://www.cipsum.com/), [Sagan Ipsum](http://saganipsum.com/), and [Online Dating Ipsum](http://laurenhallden.com/datingipsum/). Browse them all at [Meet the Ipsums](http://meettheipsums.com/) and find something appropriate for your project.

#### Step 5. Create the mobile layout

Start with general sections and big colored rectangles to divid up the content, and expand your artboard as needed. 

Add some images and icons! Illustrator is great for drawing simple icons and decorations. If you haven't used Illustrator before, check out Lynda's [Illustrator CC 2017 Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/Illustrator-CC-2017-Essential-Training/578066-2.html) — especially section five: "Drawing Basic Shapes."

Review the project description at the top of the page.

#### Step 6. Create the desktop layout

Duplicate the mobile layout so you don't have to create everything again. 

1. Zoom out and select the entire mobile layout with the Selection tool \(V\). 
2. Hold Option/Alt and drag the content over to your second artboard. Alternatively use Edit &gt;&gt;&gt; Copy, Edit &gt;&gt;&gt; Paste

Now you just have to resize your content sections and move things around until it looks good! You may want to add additional content to this larger view, but you don't have too. 

#### Step 7. Export

Once you're finished with both layouts, choose File &gt;&gt;&gt; Export &gt;&gt;&gt; Export for Screens.

Make sure you have both artboards selected on the left of this window, then choose a location for the "Export to" field. Set the format to PNG and the Scale to 1x.
