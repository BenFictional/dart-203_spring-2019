## Blog: CSS Archaeology

Develop a new post for your Wordpress blog.

**Prompt:**

Write a blog post about a particular CSS property \(or combination of related properties\) as if you are teaching the material to your readers. You should include an example of the property as it is used in a real life website, so you'll have to use the web inspector of your chosen browser \(Right-click » "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"\).

You can follow one of two paths:

1. **Start with a CSS property **— Choose a property from the CSS Crash Course page in Lesson 2, or comprehensive lists from [W3C](https://www.w3schools.com/) or [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/). Then browse websites in search of that property in use, using the Inspector to figure out if you're right.
2. **Start with a UI element on a website **— Use the Inspector to see what CSS is creating a particular visual effect, and then look up that property online to learn about it.



**Requirements**

* Write a 500-700 word guide about one CSS property \(e.g. [border-radius](https://www.w3schools.com/csSref/css3_pr_border-radius.asp)\).
* Explain three ways the property can be used, including an embedded CodePen demo for each one.
* Explain how this property can affect the user experience of websites.
* Include a screenshot\(s\) showing it in use on a real world site. One screenshot should show the Inspector panel revealing the CSS property in question. 

Students should use [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) to create three examples of HTML/CSS. Learn the basics of CodePen at their [welcome page](https://codepen.io/hello/).

1. Create an account at CodePen and create a "new pen."
2. Add one or more HTML elements in the HTML panel.
3. Add CSS properties in the CSS panel
4. Once you've created a demo, embed it in your Wordpress post by simply copying the URL for Pen and pasting it into Wordpress. Pens are public by default, so the URL functions as away to share it anywhere, and while you can
   [generate a long embed code](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/embedded-pens/)
   to insert your Pen anywhere, Wordpress can recognize the CodePen URL and generate the embed for you!

  
To learn about any CSS property, just Google it. The top results will likely be one of three popular resources:

* W3Schools: An encyclopedic database of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
* Mozilla Developer Network \(MDN\): Another extensive encyclopedia of terms and explanation; features cool interactive examples. 
* CSS Tricks: A less comprehensive and more opinionated guide, generally for a more advanced reader.

Feel free to include additional images or thoughts about how your property is used in web design, or connections to other media and design trends. 

If you want to include shorter code snippets in your Wordpress post, you can activate the SyntaxHighlighter plugin. From the Wordpress backend, click on "Plugins" on the lefthand menu and search for "Syntax." Click the "activate" button. Read about how to use the plugin on their [documentation page](http://Syntax plugin docs). These code snippets don't generate a live preview the way CodePen does, but they look nice for short passages of code.
