### Objectives

* Design a responsive one-page site based on an existing mockup
* Create a compelling design that encourages users to scroll through the content
* Use fonts, colors, and graphics to compliment the narrative content of your site. 
* Publish a functional site built with Webflow by downloading the files and hosting them on your PASS server. 

The final site should reflect your initial mockup, though you may find that certain aspect of your design need to change due to limitations of Weblfow. You may also need to change your design according to functionality—as you test your site, you may decide to adjust spacing or add additional elements to help users navigate a live website.

### Requirements

* A one-page site based around a compelling narrative \(story, lesson, poem, infographic, etc.\)
* A mix of text and images that fits your content \(there is no set number of images or word count\). 
* Hyperlinks — you must include at least one hyperlink, either a link to an external site or a navigation link.


### Optional Features

#### Anchor Links

Even though your narrative site is one page, it can still include a navigation menu to help users jump to different sections. Instead of linking to separate HTML pages, you can link to sections of the current page with **anchor links. ** or as Webflow calls them, section links.

#### Parallax and Animations

Compared to your 2D mockup, a live website is interactive—which means you can include animations, videos, audio, and other motion effects. Check out the Lynda videos on adding parallax effects and animations. The word [parallax ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax)comes from the discrepancies of vision between your two eyes, but in web design refers to a popular animation effect where elements appear to scroll at different speeds, creating illusions of depth and motion.

Animations can be triggered by interactions like a user's click, or when they hover over an element, or scroll to a certain point on a page. This is a fantastic way to add some energy and personality to your site, especially for a narrative project like this. You can animate any element (text, image, etc.) but in order to avoid overwhelming your users, ask yourself: does this animation add to the communication of my story or distract from it?

### Submission for Peer Review

Create a "narrative" folder in your PASS directory and upload your finished Muse site there when it is ready. You can use the built-in publishing feature in Muse or export as HTML and upload with Filezilla.

**The finished URL should be: **http://personal.psu.edu/yourname/narrative/index.html

### Written Component

After you publish your site, you should write a short design statement and assessment that you will submit with the final website. Refer to [the template](/lesson-2/design-summary-template.md) for details.

### Final Submission

In order to show the full development process for your website, students should submit a folder containing the following:

* Exported HTML files (within their own subfolder folder)
* Design summary \(see template\)

### Creating a Zip file

In order to upload all of the above files to Canvas, you will need to compress the folder into zip file.

![](/assets/lesson-4/package-demo.png)

**Mac:** Right-click on the container folder and choose "Compress"

**Windows:** Right-click on the container folder and choose "Send to" &gt;&gt;&gt; "Compressed \(zipped\) folder"

This will create a new .zip file alongside the container folder.

**Submit to Canvas**: Zipped project folder and the URL of your live website.
