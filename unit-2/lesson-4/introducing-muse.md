For a long time, web design students used Adobe Dreamweaver to create websites without relying on code. Adobe Muse is a newer product that almost entirely does away with code, instead relying on a graphical interface similar to Illustrator and Photoshop—this makes it easy to design websites with a "drag and drop" interface similar to the online editors we used in lesson one.

Unlike Illustrator, the design capabilities of Muse are built around CSS—which means that the various settings and tools in Muse should feel familiar since they all correspond to CSS properties. And similar to coding a site from scratch, using Adobe Muse requires good file management and labeling of assets like images and fonts.

As you work on a Muse project, it will be saved as a .MUSE project file \(like Illustrator\)—but when you export a finished site, Muse generates a folder of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and assets that you can upload directly to a remote host to publish your site. We haven't talked about Javascript, but these .JS files are just additional bits of code that allow for advanced animations and interactive functions. This is all pretty impressive, but it comes with some limitations.

Your design will be somewhat limited by the tools available in Muse, and the final code will be written according to Adobe's algorithms and not by a human developer. You can always edit the rendered HTML and CSS after it's been generated, but that gets complicated.

The final site is also a **static **website—which means you will have to edit the Muse project and re-export your project to make changes to the sites content. There is no backend like a **dynamic **site built with Wordpress.

The advantage of Muse is that you can get really creative with the layout without having to figure out how to achieve your desired results via code.

Watch the following Lynda courses to get started with Muse.

### Lynda course: [Muse Essential Training](https://www.lynda.com/Muse-tutorials/Muse-Essential-Training/532182-2.html)

**Specific highlights **— I recommend watching the full course, but if you are strapped for time, these videos are some of the most essential:

* New Site Settings
* Workspace layouts, site plan, and pages
* Muse interface overview
* Images: Place vs. Fill
* Add web fonts and format text \(using Adobe Typekit\)
* Customize buttons and the States panel
* Hyperlinks
* Anchor links \(great for one-page sites!\)
* Prepare a static site to be responsive, part 1
* Prepare a static site to be responsive, part 2
* Test in Browser

### Lynda course: [Creating a One-Page Scrollable Website in Muse](https://www.lynda.com/Muse-tutorials/Creating-One-Page-Scrollable-Website-Muse/167919-2.html)

This course doesn't go over the basic interface and tools as well as the Essential Training above, but it does walkthrough the development of a one-page scrollable site similar to the one we're working on. It also goes over some **scrolling effects** which are a fantastic way to add dynamic energy to your designs.

**Specific highlights:**

* Pinning content to the page
* Understanding scroll motion
* Changing opacity when scrolling
