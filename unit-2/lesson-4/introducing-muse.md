## Recap

So far in this course, we've examined the fundamental building blocks of the web, and studied the visual design and layout of a variety of websites. So how do we go from coding individual `<div>` elements to building a fully fledged website?

At professional design studios, a mockup like the ones we created in Lesson 3 would be handed off to a developer, who would hand-code the entire thing, likely building upon frameworks \(essentially HTML and CSS template files\) or reusing code from other projects to save time. That's still a lot of work! Coding a website manually allows you the most control over the functionality and appearance; it also lets you get the best performance because you can include only the bits of code that you need, and leave out anything unnecessary — more code means bigger files, which means slower page loading.

But for this course, we are prioritizing making great designs over mastering HTML, CSS, and Javascript. There are many resources online if you want to continue learning about those, which you should do if you are interested in developing web or mobile content. If you want to make websites without coding, there are a variety of options like Wix or Squarespace that offer attractive templates and graphic user interfaces \(GUI\) to let you "drag and drop" content around in your design without editing any code. The problem with these apps is that they are quite limited in their customization. Your websites will look like everyone else's, and it will be hard to add special functionality or visual designs beyond what the templates will allow.

## Enter Webflow

As a middle ground, we're goin to build our Narrative websites with Webflow, which is a browser-based GUI app, but one that relies on an understanding of HTML and CSS, so you can grow your development skills without typing out reams of code. This should also be easier for anyone who struggled with the HTML project in Unit 1.

Webflow is a powerful editor that includes a lot of modern CSS tools and backend control; it even has a Content Management System that lets you post content through a backend like Wordpress. The only downside, is that it's kind of expensive... unless you're in this class, in which case it's free!

After the class is over, you can create two pages for free in Webflow \(two one-page sites, or one two-page site\) and even host them for free at "[https://yoursite.webflow.io](https://yoursite.webflow.io)" — there are a variety of paid plans depending on how many sites you need and what capabilities you need. If you are building websites for a client, you can always include the cost of software in your fee.

Otherwise, even if you never use Webflow after this class, it should help you learn more about HTML and CSS elements, as well as give you valuable experience developing designs and responsive layouts.

## Team Account

You should have received an email invitation to join a team account for this class. Everyones websites will be visible through this team account. I believe you can even edit someone else's website, but those changes will be visible to everyone on the team, so don't sabotage someone else's project! I don't know why you would, but don't do it... That also means that your instructor can view your project in the editor to help you with any problems as you work.

## Hosting

Webflow lets you host your sites for free on their server, giving you URL's like "[https://yoursite.webflow.io](https://yoursite.webflow.io)" but to make sure you get more practice managing site files, you eventually will download these sites as HTML files, and upload them to your PASS server. This also ensure your sites are accessible after the course ends.

As a reminder, hosting websites on your own domains like "[https://yourname.com](https://yourname.com)" costs money. You can buy hosting from companies like Bluehost, Dreamhost, Siteground, or Go Daddy \(and many others\), which is essentially renting space on their servers. You can usually get a good deal for your first year when you purchase a plan, but the price will eventually rise to $80-120/year depending on various features.

You also need to register your domain name with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers \(ICANN\) as a separate purchase. This can be done when you purchase hosting, but you can also register a domain _without hosting_ for much less money. So if you think you _might_ someday want to put a website on "[https://sandwich.ninja](https://sandwich.ninja)" you can buy the domain name for around $10 and buy hosting later. You can do that at [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) or [Google](https://domains.google/#/).

## Tutorials

Webflow has a terrific documentation page called [Webflow University](https://university.webflow.com) that has written and video tutorials. To get started, you should view the following video series listed below. Note that you can skip the last two chapters "CMS & Dynamic Content" and "CMS Collections" — those might be useful for our next project, but are not relevant for the Narrative Websites. Also, the second video "Intro to HTML & CSS" was already featured earlier in the course.

Approximate time: 1.5 hours

NOTE: You don't need to watch the final videos in the course about CMS and dynamic content. You may wish to return to these in Unit 3.
