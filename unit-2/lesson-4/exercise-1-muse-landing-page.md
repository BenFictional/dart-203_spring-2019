This exercise is designed to get you started on building your Narrative Website with Webflow.

Create a new project in Webflow for your Narrative Website, and name it "Your Name Narrative" \(e.g. Jane Smith Narrative"\).

## Add Fonts

Add custom fonts to match those used in your mockup. To manage fonts in your project, click the top-left menu icon in the editor and select "Project Settings."

You can use custom fonts from three potential sources, and find instructions for all three methods at [Webflow University](https://university.webflow.com/topic/project-settings-fonts):

* **Google Fonts:** The easiest method, just choose fonts from a dropdown and check whichever weights and variants you need. Browser fonts at the [Google Fonts site](https://fonts.google.com).
* **Custom Font Files:** If you have a font installed on your computer, you can upload font files such as .otf or .woff \(for maximum browser support, upload multiple filetypes\). You can get files like these from sites like [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/)
* **Adobe Fonts:** You can access a library of fonts through your Adobe Creative Cloud account, but you'll have to integrate it with your Webflow account by following the instructions [here](https://university.webflow.com/article/typekit).

## Add Elements

1. From the Add Elements panel on the left, add a **Container** to the page \(learn about [Containers](https://university.webflow.com/article/container)\).
2. Add a** Columns** element inside the container with two columns \(learn about [Columns](https://university.webflow.com/article/columns)\).
3. Add a **Heading** inside one of the columns and enter some custom text as a placeholder.
4. Add a **Paragraph **inside the other column and enter some placeholder text if Lorem Ipsum doesn't appear automatically.

## Add Styles

1. Select the Body element in the editor and change the **Background color** to match your mockup. 
2. Select the Heading and change the **Font **setting in the righthand Style panel to match your custom font.
3. Change the **Color **of the Heading to match your mockup.
4. Edit the **Margin** or **Padding** values of one or more elements to push your text down from the top of the screen so it looks nice. 
5. Add any additional styles you want to any of these elements. Play around!

## Get Responsive

1. Using the device toolbar at the top-center of the Designer, select each of the devices sizes to see how the layout changes. 
2. With one of the Mobile screen sizes selected, change one or more style properties from your current design, such as Font, Color, Background Color, etc. 
3. Click back through the screen sizes and note that this new property only applies at the specific screen size. 

The goal here is to practice adding responsive styles that are triggered at certain screen sizes. You can test this by using the Preview button or even publishing the site. When published, you'll be able to slowly change the screen size and see your various visual styles kick in at different breakpoints. The Columns element automatically shifts the layout from 2-columns to 1-column but that kind of layout behavior can be created manually with more complex rules and results. 

To review using breakpoints in Webflow, watch the video [Intro to Breakpoints](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/intro-to-breakpoints-101) form the Webflow 101 Crash Course.

## Requirements

* Webflow page with Container, Columns, Heading, and Paragraph elements.
* Custom styles applied for Font, Color, and Background color.
* One or more styles changed on small screen sizes.

## Submission

* Submit screenshots of your website that show the required elements above \(in Preview mode or a live Published page\) . 

_**Once finished, you may delete these HTML elements and styles if they are not useful in your actual website. You can continue working in the same Webflow Project for your Narrative Site. **_

Submit to Canvas.
