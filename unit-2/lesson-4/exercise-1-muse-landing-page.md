This exercise is designed to get you started on building your Narrative Website with Webflow. 

Create a new project in Webflow for your Narrative Website, and name it "Your Name Narrative" (e.g. Jane Smith Narrative").

## Add Fonts
Add custom fonts to match those used in your mockup. To manage fonts in your project, click the top-left menu icon in the editor and select "Project Settings."

You can use custom fonts from three potential sources, and find instructions for all three methods at [Webflow University](https://university.webflow.com/topic/project-settings-fonts):

* **Google Fonts:** The easiest method, just choose fonts from a dropdown and check whichever weights and variants you need. Browser fonts at the [Google Fonts site](https://fonts.google.com).
* **Custom Font Files:** If you have a font installed on your computer, you can upload font files such as .otf or .woff (for maximum browser support, upload multiple filetypes). You can get files like these from sites like [Font Squirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/)
* **Adobe Fonts:** You can access a library of fonts through your Adobe Creative Cloud account, but you'll have to integrate it with your Webflow account by following the instructions [here](https://university.webflow.com/article/typekit).

## Get Responsive
Select the body element in the editor and change the background color to approximate the background in your mockup.

Now add a header and a paragraph element to the page and set the color, size, and font according to your design. This can be placeholder content such as [Lorem Ipsum](https://www.lipsum.com/feed/html) or [alternative ipsums](https://idsgn.dropmark.com/107).

Change the "screen size" using the desktop, tablet, or mobile icons at top-center of editor, and adjust the placement, color, or other setting for one of your HTML elements. The goal is have one or more visual styles change when the browser resizes, to practice adding responsive behavior to the site. You could also change the background color of the body element or some other HTML element. 

To review using breakpoints in Webflow, watch the video [Intro to Breakpoints](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/intro-to-breakpoints-101) form the Webflow 101 Crash Course.

You can test this by using the Preview button or even publishing the site. When published, you'll be able to slowly change the screen size and see your various visual styles kick in at different breakpoints. 

## Requirements

* Webflow page with custom fonts set for header and paragraph text. 
* Change some visual style at each of the four breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile-landscape, and mobile-portrait). Such as text color, size, placement, background color, anything with a div element, etc.

## Submission

Submit four screenshots of your website (in preview mode or published), showing four unique visual styles for your content, one for each breakpoint. 

Submit to Canvas.
