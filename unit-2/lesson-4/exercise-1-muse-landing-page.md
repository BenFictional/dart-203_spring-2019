### Design and Publish

After watching the videos above, create a single page in Muse that includes at least one text element and a background color \(so it's not just a blank page\). Feel free to make it silly, this is just a placeholder.

You can upload your files with either of the following methods \(as seen in the video above\):

1. **Publish through Muse:** File &gt;&gt;&gt; Upload to FTP Host — and enter your FTP credentials like you did in Filezilla.
2. **FTP Client:**  File &gt;&gt;&gt; Export as HTML — and then upload the files with Filezilla. 

### Submission

Take a screenshot of your Muse project displaying your web page.

Take a screenshot of your published webpage that includes the URL. Note that the URL for a live site should being with "http://.." and not "file://user..."

Submit the two screenshots and the URL for your web page to the following Canvas assignment:
