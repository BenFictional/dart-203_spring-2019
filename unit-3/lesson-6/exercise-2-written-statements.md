For this exercise, students will complete a written design summary similar to previous assignments, but with an additional written component.

### Objectives:

* Articulate the design goals and approach for the final website.
* Define a broader creative context for your work in web design by writing an artist statement or design philosophy. 
* Prepare the text content for your site as a text document. 

Students should complete a Design Summary using the same template we've used in the past. Leave the "Revision" section blank for now.

#### Artist Statement/Design Philosophy

In addition, students should write an artist statement or design philosophy about their creative practice beyond this particular website. Artist statements are a common document used in art and media fields, intended to summarize the practice of an individual and provide a context for their work. If you consider yourself more of a designer, your statement might not reflect your own internal interests, so much as your philosophy for approaching projects and implementing them in the world.

**What to include in an artist statement/design statement:**

* An accessible description of your creative work. You might mention specific projects, but you should definitely use descriptive language to help readers picture what your work looks like. Use lots of adjectives. 
* Connections to other artists, designers, media, or external influences. Don't include a lot of detail here, but it might help readers to understand the context and goals of your work. Art and design are conversations; they don't happen in a vacuum.
* What you're into. What excites you about making creative work? What ideas or processes are you interested in? 
* Personal details. You can include some biographical information, but you might also include an anecdote from your life that relate to your work. Often employers or clients will ask for an artists statement _and_ a bio, so save your college degrees for the bio. 

**If you're leaning more towards design...**

* Describe your perspective of design. What are some meaningful experiences you've had with design \(of any kind\).
* What is good design? Tell your readers what you consider to be effective and meaningful design. How does your work aspire to that meet that ideal? 
* Include more external examples and influences. A design statement is a little more like a manifesto, you should present a world view, and explain how your own experiences fit into it.

#### Content Outline

The final written component is a document containing all the text for your website. It's always a good idea to write body text in Word or similar text editor, so you can easily share it with collaborators and spell-check everythingâ€”ALWAYS SPELL-CHECK EVERYTHING.

This is also helpful if you're not sure what to label certain parts of the site. Not sure if you should call a page "Projects" or "Work" or "Gallery?"  Write down a bunch of ideas  and choose your favorite.

### Requirements

* Artist Statement/Design Philosophy
  * Write in the first person \(e.g. "My work is inspired by..."\)
  * 2-5 paragraphs \(one page max\)
* Design Summary \(same format we've been using\)
* Website Content
  * Use different font sizes to denote headers and body text. 
  * Denote each page with a horizontal rule or other label.

### Blog

Your blog prompt for this lesson is to post you artist statement/design philosophy to your Wordpress blog. Students will submit the blog post for peer review as we have done in the past, and comment on each other's posts in Open Studio. This will give you an opportunity to revise your statement before the end of the lesson. 

Check the course schedule for the due dates.
