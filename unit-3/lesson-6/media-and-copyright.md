If you're making a portfolio site, you will probably be using a lot of your own images, but if you're making a fictional business site, you may need to find some images and videos to add to your design. The following resources are useful places to get high quality media files licensed for free use—and in order to explain what that means, now seems like a good time to go over copyright policies for artists and designers.

### Copyright

According to the [United States Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Clause), the government has the power “_To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.”_

**Translation:** Authors and inventors \(and designers\) have exclusive ownership of anything they make for a limited time.

You don't have to do anything to copyright a creative work; as long as you make something, it belongs to you. You can't copyright an idea, but as soon as you create a website \(or illustration, poster, movie, book, song, comic, etc.\) you have a claim of ownership. In order to strengthen that claim, you can [register your work with the government](http://copyright.gov) \(for $35\) to get official documentation of your ownership. Most people don't bother with that step, but it will give you peace of mind in the event of any legal dispute.

The easier way to "prove" ownership is to just include a copyright statement somewhere on your website \(or other design\): e.g. "© Jane Smith, 2018." Wordpress even adds a statement like that to your footer automatically.

The length of a copyright claim varies in different countries, but in the U.S. it lasts 120 years from the date of creation or 70 years from the author's death. After that point, the creative work enters the **public domain, **and it can be used by anyone without fear of legal repercussions.

It's important to understand that the entire point of copyright is to make sure that cool ideas eventually enter the public domain. The reward of temporary ownership was designed to keep inventors and authors from holding onto their family secrets for generations. Copyright was developed to benefit the public and ensure that cultural creations were eventually accessible to everyone.

### Creative Commons

Traditional media companies like to hold onto their copyrighted material because it makes money. In 1998, Disney even lobbied Congress to [extend the term of copyright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act) in order to prevent Mickey Mouse from entering the public domain \(that extension runs out in 2019, so stay tuned for another potential update to copyright law\). But with the rise of the Internet and remix culture, many creators have begun to appreciate the value of easy access, adopting an alternative copyright method.

If you want people to be able to use your work for free, you can license your work with a Creative Commons license. You can even  choose a restrictions on the use of your material, such as requiring people to credit you as the original author, or ensuring that people only use your work for noncommercial purposes.

This more-open way of distributing your work encourages free publicity and creative remixing. Thanks to generous content creators, there are many great places to find images, videos, and audio like the ones below. Learn how to register your work at the Creative Commons website.

### Fair Use

If you want to use copyrighted work, you have two options:

1. **Just use it and hope no one cares.** Student projects are not going to be seen by a lot of people, and you're probably not going to make a ton of money, so a company like Disney probably won't sue you. But as a professional designer, you don't want your clients to be liable for legal action, so it's a good idea to just start practicing good copyright use. 
2. **Fair Use**: change the work enough that it no longer resembles the original.  

If you manipulate a photo of Mickey Mouse in Photoshop until it no longer resembles a mouse in any way, and you use it for a purpose totally removed it's original purposes, then your new work would be protected in court under fair use. Most copyright disputes come down to lawyers arguing in court—these things are pretty subjective.

The original Battlestar Galactica \(1978\)  came out one year after Star Wars \(1977\), prompting 20th Century Fox to [sue for copyright infringement](http://ut.lawstudentland.com/post/112081931892/star-wars-v-battlestar-galactic-saga-of-a-fact), citing a number of similar visual designs, sound effects, and story elements. The two parties settled out of court, by which time the offending series had been canceled.

More recently, a humorous blog called [McMansion Hell](http://mcmansionhell.com/) shut down in 2017 after receiving a cease and desist letter from online realtor Zillow. The blog used images from Zillow listings to critique the architecture of "McMansions." Lawyers from the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/) threatened to countersue Zillow, on the grounds that the blog qualified for fair use—the images were obviously satirical, and no one was buying houses from McMansion Hell. [Zillow backed down](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/06/29/an-online-housing-giant-picked-a-fight-with-a-one-woman-blog-and-lost/?utm_term=.0a900842fb14), and the blog returned.

### Resources

If you want to avoid potential legal trouble, start using creative commons or public domain media for your projects. Here are some good resources for web designers:

* [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) — Large photos that are great for background images. These are very generic and trendy, but useful. 
* [Google Image Search \(plus filters\)](https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/find-creative-commons-images-with-image.html) — Click "Tools" to specify usage rights. 
* [Flickr \(plus filters\)](https://www.flickr.com) — Click "Advanced" to choose Creative Commons licenses. Flickr always has unique images because they're taken by ordinary photographers.
* [Coverrs](http://www.coverr.co/) — Free library of videos meant for use as web backgrounds.
* [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/) — Fabulous library of CC icons
* [Google Material Design Icons](https://material.io/icons/) — More icons for when you want that Google Material Design look. 

### Crediting Authors

If you use media from any of these sites, **you must include appropriate credit** for the original author in your site.

Some licenses specify that you must credit the author, some may allow blanket use without any credit \(called "Creative Commons Zero" or public domain\). You might include a few lines of credits in your site footer, or include a link on your About page.

**Creating your own graphics or using original photography will always be rewarded during grading.**

Be original and share alike.
