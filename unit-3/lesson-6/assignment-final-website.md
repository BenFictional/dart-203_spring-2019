This is itâ€”the final project!

### Objectives

* Design a website with a consistent color palette, font set, and branding style that matches your content.
* Develop a multi-page business or portfolio website.
* Add hyperlinks, navigation menus, and other interactive content to create an functional user experience. 
* Publish the site online using FTP.

Review the Final Website Overview in Lesson 5 to refresh yourself on the premise of the website, but you should have a pretty good idea what you're doing by this point.

Use the tutorials linked to on the Advanced Webflow page for guidance and search on [Webflow University](https://university.webflow.com/) for additional help.

### Requirements for the final site

* The final site must be published online through your remote PASS hosting.
  * The URL should be:** **[http://personal.psu.edu/YourName/final/index.html](http://personal.psu.edu/YourName/final/index.html)
  * The folder named "final" should contain all of the files exported from Webflow.
* Your site must have at least five pages, including a designated home page.

* Each page must have a header, navigation menu, and footer.

* The site must contain at least five images and/or videos.

### Submission for Peer Review

For the peer review you may share your site using Webflow's hosting. Just publish the site and share the public URL. 

Please also submit a screenshot of your site to the Studio submission.

### Submission to Canvas

For the final submission you should download the files from Webflow and upload them to your PASS server. That way you can access the site after this course ends and your free Webflow account is revoked. This is also how professional sites are maintained, so it's important to master this kind of file management. 

Download the HTML files and upload them to PASS using Filezilla or the browser explorer. Refer to the pages in Lesson 2 for help with this process. 

Submit the following to Canvas: 

* Exported site files in a zipped folder \(The HTML files downloaded from Webflow\). 
* Written design summary \(updated to include revision and self assessment\).
* Public URL to your site on PASS \(Included in design summary or as a Canvas comment\).
