* Develop a multi-page business or portfolio website.
* Add hyperlinks, navigation menus, and other interactive content to create an functional user experience.

Review the Final Website Overview in Lesson 5 to refresh yourself on the premise of the website, but you should have a pretty good idea what you're doing by this point.
