This is itâ€”the final project!

### Objectives

* Design a website with a consistent color palette, font set, and branding style that matches your content.
* Develop a multi-page business or portfolio website.
* Add hyperlinks, navigation menus, and other interactive content to create an functional user experience. 
* Publish the site online using FTP.

Review the Final Website Overview in Lesson 5 to refresh yourself on the premise of the website, but you should have a pretty good idea what you're doing by this point. 

Use the Lynda courses listed throughout Unit 2 and 3 as reference for working with Muse.
