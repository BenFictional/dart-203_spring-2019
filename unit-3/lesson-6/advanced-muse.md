##[CMS and dynamic content](https://university.webflow.com/courses/cms-and-dynamic-content-course)

_Length: 40min_

It's not required to use Webflow's CMS tools for this class, but it could be useful for some of your projects, and it's a good concept to  master for future development work. 

So far, all the websites we've built in this class have been **static content** — you design the files exactly as you want them and the sit there online.

**Dynamic content** can grab text or images from a database and populate one or more pages with that content. This is how Wordpress generates a unique page for each of your blog posts using the same layout every time. It's how every product page on Amazon looks essentially the same, but swaps in different text and images.  

As a designer, dynamic websites allow you to design **one** page layout for products, blog posts, or staff bios, rather than creating 10, 20, or 100 different files for each "item." When you change the font size or layout of that single template page, it will be applied to every page. 

Typically dynamic content is created through a backend, like how you've been composing your Wordpres posts in the editor and then publishing them to the public site. 

Webflow includes a powerful CMS toolset, that can allow you to create these template pages—potentially useful if you're making a series of pages for products or projects.
