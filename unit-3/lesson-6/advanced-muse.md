There are a ton of videos available at Webflow University, but here are the ones most relevant to this project:

##[Building Grid Layouts](https://university.webflow.com/courses/grid)
_Length: 9min_

This course goes over how to implement grid layouts using Flexbox and CSS Grid. Some of this should be familiar, but for professional-looking sites it's imperative to get everything aligned and spaced out nicely, so this is important to master. 

##[CMS and dynamic content](https://university.webflow.com/courses/cms-and-dynamic-content-course)

_Length: 40min_

It's not required to use Webflow's CMS tools for this class, but it could be useful for some of your projects, and it's a good concept to  master for future development work. 

So far, all the websites we've built in this class have been **static content** — you design the files exactly as you want them and the sit there online.

**Dynamic content** can grab text or images from a database and populate one or more pages with that content. This is how Wordpress generates a unique page for each of your blog posts using the same layout every time. It's how every product page on Amazon looks essentially the same, but swaps in different text and images.  

As a designer, dynamic websites allow you to design **one** page layout for products, blog posts, or staff bios, rather than creating 10, 20, or 100 different files for each "item." When you change the font size or layout of that single template page, it will be applied to every page. 

» ADD DYNAMIC IMAGE

Typically dynamic content is created through a backend, like how you've been composing your Wordpres posts in the editor and then publishing them to the public site. 

Webflow includes a powerful CMS toolset, that can allow you to create these template pages—potentially useful if you're making a series of pages for products or projects.

**You don't have to use Webflow's CMS tools:** If you only have five pages, you can just design one page, duplicate it, and make your changes as you go. 


##[Building a Business Website](https://university.webflow.com/courses/full-project-build-business-website)
_Length: 1hr 25min_

This course goes over how to create a typical business site layout, and more importantly, how to set up dynamic CMS pages like employee bios or product pages. Watch the general CMS videos first, and consider this additional guidance if needed. 

##[Crating a custom portfolio](https://university.webflow.com/lesson/portfolio-website-part-1)

Whatdaya know... another course tailor made for this project! This course also uses the CMS tools, which you don't have to use. But this could still be useful, and it goes over fixed navigation menus and contact forms. 

## [Symbols](https://university.webflow.com/article/symbols)
This is the simplest way to reuse elements on multiple pages, such as a navbar or footer. Even if you're not using the CMS tools, this allows you to avoid changing the font-size on your header five times.
