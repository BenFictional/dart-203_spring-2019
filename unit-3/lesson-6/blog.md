### Blog

Your blog prompt for this lesson is to post your artist statement/design philosophy to your Wordpress blog. This should be the same text you wrote for Exercise 2.

Include one or more images/videos alongside the text.

Students will submit the blog post for peer review as we have done in the past, and comment on each other's posts in Open Studio. This will give you an opportunity to revise your statement before the end of the lesson.

Check the course schedule for the due dates.
