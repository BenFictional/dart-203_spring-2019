This exercise is pretty straight-forward; we're going to create a single Master page in Muse, that you can use as a template for developing your site. 

### Objectives

* Set up a Muse project for a multi-page business/portfolio site.

* Create a Master page for use as a template. 



Design a Master page in Muse for any page in your site. It should be a page layout that you can reuse for other pages, such as an "About" page or a "Project" page. If your homepage has a totally unique layout, you wouldn't create a Master page for it.

You don't have to make it totally responsive yet, and you don't have to include fully interactive links or other unique content, but you should include a navigation menu, footer, and implement your color palette. 



### Requirements

* Submit a screenshot of your Master page in Muse, showing the full editor window. 
* The design must include a header, navigation menu, and footer.
