This exercise is pretty straight-forward; we're going to create a single Master page in Muse, that you can use as a template for developing your site. 

## Objectives

* Create a Webflow project for a multi-page business/portfolio site.
* Create one page to showcase your color palette, typography, and overall page layout. 
* Include a responsive navigation menu with links for all your top-level pages.

## Instructions

**Create a navigation menu** in Webflow, referring to the [Navbar documentation](https://university.webflow.com/article/navbar) or tutorials listed earlier in this lesson for help. 

Depending on your design, this could be a horizontal or vertical menu, it could be in the header or fixed at the bottom of the page. It might be very conventional or totally weird and unique, but it should list all your main pages. 

Ensure that the menu adapts to different screen sizes effectively. Consider adding styles for "hover" and "active" nav items. 

** Add some placeholder content** In the main body of your page, set the size and color of your background and main content area. 

Add a header and a paragraph of body text; you can use placeholder text for now, this is just to get your main visual styles into Webflow and make sure your fonts and colors are ready to go. 



## Requirements

* Submit screenshots of the following:
    * Page at a large screen width showing the desktop nav menu.
    * Page at a small screen width showing the mobile nav menu. 
* The page must include a text header and paragraph with unique font styles. 
* Define the background color (don't just leave it white).
