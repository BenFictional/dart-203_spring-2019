Complete this exercise after you have completed Exercise 1.

Now that you have identified the needs and goals of your website, we will return to the research and brainstorming techniques we have used previously. But because your first idea is usually not your best, students will imagine three different designs for the website. It is a common practice for designers to to present multiple ideas to a client, and even when designing for your own projects, it is useful to experiment with different approached. You may end up picking and choosing elements from more than one of these designs.

Imagine **three different designs** for your final site. Each design should be **dramatically different in style and layout**. See how your site would look with vertical scrolling or horizontal scrolling. Try out a dark background or a light background. Organic o geometric. If you have trouble thinking of a different approach, consider what the opposite of your current idea would be.

**For each design, create the following: **

* A brief written abstract that summarizes your approach.
* Sketches of each page. 
  * Label each of the main pages and mark how they are connected \(essentially a basic wireframe\).
  * You don't have to include every single header and UI button, but include the essential sections and features, with enough labeling to help someone else understand your ideas.
  * You can make physical drawings and scan them or create sketches in Illustrator/Photoshop.
* Mood board \(at least five images\)
* Color palette \(5 colors\)
* Font Pair \(A header and body font\)

### Submission

You can use any of the mood board tools or color pickers from previous lessons, but it may be easiest to create all of these assets in a single Illustrator project so you can easily export a single PDF for each design.

Use the Artboard window to create additional artboards.

Add all of the various elements for each design. If you draw your sketches by hand you can scan them and insert them as images. Your sketches should be more detailed than these :\)

To export all of your artboards as a single PDF:

* 1. Save your project first.
  2. File &gt;&gt;&gt; Save as &gt;&gt;&gt; Choose PDF as filetype. 
  3. Click Okay in the PDF Export window
  4. Close the Illustrator project.

Because Illustrator can edit PDF's to some extent, when you save your .AI project as a PDF, your Illustrator window will switch over to editing the .PDF fileâ€”if you continue to edit the PDF file, when you hit "Save" you won't be updating your original .AI project. So just close out the PDF and reopen the .AI file if you want to keep working on it. Alternatively you can use File &gt;&gt;&gt; "Export for Screens" and export each artboard as a separate PDF, and then combine them in Adobe Acrobat. Neither solution is idealm, but that's how I've always done it.

Note the different filename displayed in the tab for these Illustrator projects. After you "Save As" a PDF, your open window will become the PDF and not the original .AI file.

### Submit to Canvas

Submit all of the items listed above for three separate design ideas. Organize and label your files clearly!

Either put all your materials in a single PDF as shown above, or sort them into three folders that you zip before uploading.
