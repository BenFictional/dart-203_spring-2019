The final unit will focus on designing and developing a multi-page website based on either of the following prompts:

* A personal portfolio site \(showcasing your creative work\)
* A business or corporate site for a fictional group. 

If you know of a real business or group that needs a website, you may contact the instructor to discuss using that as the subject matter for the final website. 

This website should look professional and function in an intuitive manner. The previous sites we've made have been experimental "art sites", but this site should be inviting and functionalâ€”that isn't to say it has to be boring, you are encouraged to make visually distinctive and creative designs, but the sites will include  expectations and functionality that we haven't had to deal with previously. 

Students will develop the appearance of the site throughout this lesson, but for now just start thinking about what you would like to choose as your subject matter.
