## Final Site

This lesson focuses on building the website developed in lesson 5. Students will use Adobe Muse to crate a multi-page site that meets the goals outlined in students' initial proposals.

This is an opportunity to practice all of the techniques and concepts we've covered in this course:

* Human-friendly design—remember affordances and signifiers? 
* Effective use of color
* Unique, readable typography
* Vector artwork and photos
* Accessibility and SEO
* CSS—Add in some custom CSS if you can't Muse to do what you want.

Students should push their designs beyond what they accomplished in their first Muse site. Try some new tools and experiment! Just because we're making "professional" sites doesn't mean they have to look boring.
