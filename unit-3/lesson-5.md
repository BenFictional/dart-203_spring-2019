## Ideation

This lesson will prepare students to build their final project website in Lesson 6. We will return to some of the tools and methods used in Unit 2, and add some additional techniques for developing a website. As with any creative work, your first idea is almost never the final solution; we will brainstorm a variety of ideas for the next website and begin outlining them as students assess the needs  and goals of their website.
