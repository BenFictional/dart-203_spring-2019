Lesson 2 serves as an overview of HTML and CSSâ€”the primary languages of web design. The focus of this course is not on coding, but an understanding of these essential languages will be invaluable for the rest of the course and your future as a designer/developer. This lesson provides introductory tutorials, resources for further learning, and, easy-to-use template files.

As we familiarize ourselves with the structure of HTML, we will also look at the technology and history that has shaped it. After using the Wordpress CMS to publish content in Lesson 1, we will look at exactly how that content gets online and take a more manual approach to publishing.

This lesson includes:

* Exercise 1: HTML Roadtest
* Exercise 2: Grid Sketch
* Assignment: Landing Page
* Blog post: Grid Examples
