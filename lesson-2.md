# HTML + CSS = ♡

Lesson 2 serves as an overview of HTML and CSS—the primary languages of web design. The focus of this course is not on coding, but an understanding of these essential languages will be invaluable for the rest of the course and your future as a designer/developer.

If you have worked with HTML and CSS previously, you can skim the instructional text and continue the develop you skills in the assignments. If you have never used raw code before, don't fear! This lesson provides introductory tutorials, resources for further learning, and, easy-to-use template files.

As we familiarize ourselves with the structure of HTML, we will also look at the technology and history that has shaped it. After using commercial platforms to publish web content in Lesson 1, we will look at exactly how that content gets online and take a more manual approach to publishing.
