As a PSU student, you can access a free subscription to the Adobe Creative Cloud—the industry-leading suite of creative applications. We will use Adobe Muse for some assignments, but you may also want to use Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator to create graphics and format images for use in all sorts of web projects. 

A subscription to the entire Adobe suite normally costs $50/month or $20/month for students and educators. 

Here's how to set up your free subscription through Penn State:

1. Register for your free account through the[ Software at Penn State site](https://software.psu.edu/adobe-student-lic/-8319). It's set up like you're purchasing something, but the cost is $0.00. 
2. Download the [Adobe Create Cloud desktop app](http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/catalog/desktop.html). Once installed, you can use this application to install and manage individual apps like Photoshop or Muse. 
3. Open the Creative Cloud app, and sign-in with your Penn State credentials. In OSX you can access this from the top toolbar, or Windows it's located in the bottom toolbar \(though you can always find the application listed under 'Applications' too\).
4. Sign-in with you university or employer ID. If you have a personal Adobe account, _do not enter that username and password_—you must sign-in with your PSU account if you want to take advantage of the free subscription. 
5. Install whichever apps you want. For this class, we will use Photoshop, Illustrator, and Muse.
