Since this course is meant to explore the use of websites and online tools, it's fitting that we'll be diving into a plethora of different applications and services to accomplish out goals.

This course uses both its own interface to organize and deliver the course content \(the pages you are viewing right now\) and the  Canvas learning management system \(that some of your other Penn State classes may also use\). In this course, you will use  Canvas for quizzes, and uploading some of your assignments. You will also use Canvas for e-mail communication, course announcements, and important notifications. We will refer to the class website as the Course Pages so it's easier to distinguish between the Course Pages and Canvas.

.

### Course Pages

A multi-page website that can accommodate a variety of content, including videos and galleries of student work \(in the Open Studio section of the site\). You can always navigate to the site from Canvas, but it's a good idea to bookmark it for easy access.

### Open Studio

You can access the Open Studio from the top navigation menu on the course website. This provides a series of galleries where students can submit work and comment on each other's submissions. Each assignment will have it's own link, and you will often be directed to specific assignments from other pages, but you can also click "Assignments" to view a list of all course assignments and navigate to the one you want.

### **Canvas**

Penns Stateâ€™s overarching hub for courses \(you're probably familiar with this from other courses\). The home page for this course will list a week-by-week schedule, with links to the relevant Course Pages. Canvas also includes Assignments where you will submit work for the instructor to grade. Check here for grades and personal feedback from the instructor.
