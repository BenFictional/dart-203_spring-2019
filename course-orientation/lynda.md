In order to learn some of the software used in this course, we will rely on the amazing tutorial videos from Lynda.

These videos normally require a paid subscription, but are free for students at Penn State.

Access Lynda videos at [http://lynda.psu.edu/](http://lynda.psu.edu/)

Or sign in at the regular [Lynda site](http://lynda.com)  and choose "Sign in with your organization portal" â€”as seen below.
