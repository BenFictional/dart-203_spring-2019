Most assignments will be submitted through Canvas, where the instructor will provide individual feedback and grades. As a visual design course, we will also be submitting some work through Open Studio \(a dedicated page on the course website\). 



**Open Studio: **class-wide galleries of images for each assignment. Students will leave comments here during peer reviews for exercises, assignments, and blog posts. While students will maintain live websites for their blogs, you will be asked to post screenshots and links to each blog on Open Studio so that peer reviews can all be centrally located. 

**Canvas:** submissions to the instructor will receive private feedback and grades. In some instances you will be asked to submit screenshots of your websites, blog posts, or submissions in Open Studio. In addition, some assignments will require students to submit project files or other filetypes not accepted in Open Studio.
