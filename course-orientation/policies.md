## University Policies

### 1. Disablility/alternate media

If you have a documented disability, send a copy of the letter from the Office of Disability services to your instructor \(using Canvas email\). If you suspect that you have a disability but have not been assessed, you must contact the Office of Disability Services at: http://equity.psu.edu/ods/applying-for-services-from-ods  



### 2. Student Misconduct

Clearly, both the online and the face-to-face learning world present similar chances for inappropriate student behaviors. All expectations and policies regarding student conduct are ultimately guided by Penn State’s Code of Conduct: http://studentaffairs.psu.edu/conduct/codeofconduct/

In brief, the University’s Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity, respect other students’ dignity, rights and property, and help create and maintain an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts. Any student behaving in a manner which violates these essential principles will be subject to disciplinary sanctions.



### 3. Plagiarism/academic integrity

Academic integrity — the pursuit of scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner, free of fraud and deception — is an important educational objective of Penn State. Academic integrity is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in accordance with this principle.

All students in this class agree to abide by the principles of academic integrity. All cases of dishonesty in this course, including cheating on examinations and quizzes, or plagiarism on writing assignments, will not be tolerated and will be dealt with according to the policies of the University. Cheating by sharing information during or about exams and quizzes or using unauthorized materials will result in an AUTOMATIC ZERO for the student’s assessment and further action as outlined by University policy.

Academic dishonesty can lead to a failing grade or referral to the Office of Student Conduct. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to:

* Cheating
* Plagiarism
* Fabrication of information or citations
* Facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others
* Unauthorized prior possession of examinations
* Submitting the work of another person or work previously used without informing the instructor and securing written approval
* Tampering with the academic work of other students

### 4. Copyright Policy

All course materials students receive or to which students have online access are protected by copyright laws. Students may use course materials and make copies for their own use as needed, but unauthorized distribution and/or uploading of materials without the instructor’s express permission is strictly prohibited.  Students who engage in the unauthorized distribution of copyrighted materials may be held in violation of the University’s Code of Conduct, and/or liable under Federal and State laws. University Policy AD 40, the University Policy Recording of Classroom Activities and Note Taking Services addresses this issue more specifically: https://guru.psu.edu/policies/AD40.html

### 5. Communication Policy

University policy dictates that the instructor cannot discuss academic information with students via e-mail EXCEPT when messages are sent to and from your PSU e-mail account.
