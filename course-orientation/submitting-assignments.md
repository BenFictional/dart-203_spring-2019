Due to the variety of projects and filetypes involved in web design, we will submit work to a few different locations:

**Open Studio: **class-wide galleries of images for each assignment. Students will leave comments here during peer reviews for exercises, assignments, and blog posts.

**Canvas:** submissions to the instructor will receive private feedback and grades.

**The Internet:** Some assignments will involve publishing web content online. In those cases, you will include a URL with your submissions to Canvas and Open Studio. Your blogs will also be published online.
