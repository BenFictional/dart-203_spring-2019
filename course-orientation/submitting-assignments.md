Due to the variety of projects and filetypes involved in web design, we will submit work to a few different locations:

**Open Studio: **class-wide galleries of images usually submitted as works-in-progress \(aka drafts\). Students will leave comments here during peer review weeks.

**Canvas:** submissions to the instructor will receive private feedback and grades.

**The Internet:** Some assignments will involve publishing web content online. In those cases, you will include a URL with your submissions to Canvas or Open Studio. Your blogs will also be published online.

### Open Studio Instructions

When an assignment is due, you will find a button on the course page will have a button that will direct you to where you can submit your assignment. When you are in the open studio environment you can always toggle back and forth between pages; just select the network icon in the upper left hand corner, and then select "content outline" to return to the lessons pages.

Below please find a description of each tab located in the open studio:

**Recent Activity: **Self-explanatory.

**Project Management: **This page allows you to see each assignment, grouped by unit and lesson. Once you click on an assignment, you will find a description and submission link. All images can be uploaded as a either jpg, png, or gif.
