## Schedule

Here is the basic course of events for each lesson; for exact dates, please refer to the course syllabus. 

1. **Instructional Content**: Begin each lesson by reading all of the instructional content on the course website; this may include watching tutorial videos or readings. 
2. **Exercises: **these are designed as preparation for the more extensive and open-ended assignments.
3. **Assignment**: students will complete a draft of each assignment, though it should look polished and fulfill the requirements.
4. **Blogs: **written responses to prompts, including related images and media will be posted to student's individual research blogs. 
5. **Peer Reviews**: students will provide feedback on each other's assignments and blogs. The day after assignments are due, they will be "open for review" and all students will be required to leave comments on the work in Open Studio. Peer reviews will typically be due 2-3 days after the assignment. This means it is important to submit your assignments and blogs on time.
6. **Revisions: **Students will have a brief period to revise their assignments and blogs after receiving feedback from their peers. It is expected that the final version of each show changes from the first draft, and address the comments received during peer review. 

_**All work is due at 11:59pm of the day specified. **_
