## Schedule

This course is divided into three units, each containing two lessons. See the course schedule for the dates of each lesson. 

Each lesson contains:

* Tutorials and instructional content
* 2 Exercises

* 1 Blog post

You should begin each lesson reading through all of the content to get an idea of what we'll be doing. Complete the exercises first, as they are instructional exercises designed to prepare you for the more open-ended assignment.
