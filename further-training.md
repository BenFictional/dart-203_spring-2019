The exercises and assignment in this lesson are all designed to prepare students to build a final website in Lesson 6, so let's go over the basic requirements of the final website as we begin the design process.

For the final website, students can choose either of the following subjects:

* 1. **A personal portfolio site **— collecting examples of your own creative work and information about your practice.
  2. **A business site **— based on a fictional business, or if students are involved in an actual business or program in need of a website, they may use it as the subject for this site.

The final website will include multiple pages with unique content, and a navigation menu that links the pages together. The website should look professional and maintain good standards of accessibility and functionality. 

The appearance and design of your site will evolve over the course of this lesson, but you should start thinking about what the subject matter of site will be.
