Overview of code-free website tools

Most of us spend our whole days online, and as such there are _a lot_ of different tools for building websites. Some of these tools are simpler or more complex than others, and I think it's useful to understand what's out there, and try a variety of tools. Even the simple platforms that might not seem "professional" might prove useful when your friend needs to build a website in time for dinner. 

We're going to get into the nitty gritty of how web content works, and just what the heck an HTTP is, but first let's see what we can build with absolutely zero experience in the field of web design—you might be surprised. 

There are a lot of "code-free" editors that try to make the process of web development as easy as making a Powerpoint presentation—many of these tools are free, and some even run in your web browser. These visual editors hide the code involved in structuring a website and aim to let users design by simply dragging and dropping elements around the screen. If you think about it, programs like Adobe Photoshop or even your operating system also run on code, and have evolved sophisticated graphical user interfaces \(GUI\) to make things as intuitive as possible. 

The limitation with these visual editors is that by simplifying the design process, they risk making it _too_ simple and taking away  functionality or customization. So, is the tradeoff worth it? Let's give it a try.
