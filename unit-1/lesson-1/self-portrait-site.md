Your assignment for this week to to make a Self Portrait website that introduces you to the class. It would be nice to include a photo of yourself, but it's not required. Do  include some text and images that provide a glimpse into what makes you the person you are. You might include:

* Where you live
* Your job
* Why you're taking this class
* Your own work in web, art, or media
* Work by your favorite artists, filmmakers, or designers. 
* What you had for dinner.
* Hobbies, pets, fandoms, etc.

**You can use any of the following platforms:**

* [Carrd](https://carrd.co): This is a new-ish platform for making single-page websites, so it's somewhat limited but seems very modern and customizable. 
* [Weebly](https://www.weebly.com/): A more powerful editor for creating code-free websites, which actually does let you edit some of the code for more specific customizations. 
* [Wix](http://www.wix.com/): Very similar to Wix, in the past I've found it to be somewhat less flexible for updating and customizing sites, but I havne't used it in a while so if you like the look of the themes herem then give it a try!
* [Tilda](https://tilda.cc): A relative newcomer to the field, I haven't used this platform myself, but it seems to have a lot of options, and supports up to 50 pages for a free website. 
* [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com): Ostensibly a blogging and social media platform, it is possible to build portfolio or personal sites with Tumblr, but it will be built around the preset Tumblr post types: image, video, quote, text, etc. 
* [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/): This one's been around for ages, but it just went though a major update to make the sites look more contemporary. 

* Wordpress: Wordpress blogs should be considered among these options, but we're going to use Wordpress more extensively throughout this course, so I'd prefer that you not use it for this assignment. 

Whichever platform you choose, you'll have to create an account to use it; use whatever email you like, we won't we using these website beyond this assignment. 

When you're finished make sure that you **publish** the site so it's visible on the web. You should get a short URL \(e.g. http://my-awesome-site.tumblr.com\) that is different than the URL you'll see when you're editing the site. 

Submit the public URL for your site at the following discussion board:
