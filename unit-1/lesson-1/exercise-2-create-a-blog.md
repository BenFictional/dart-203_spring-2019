Students will use their research blogs throughout the course, but for this exercise we're just interested in creating the blogs through PSU Sites. 

Step One

* Go to sites.psu.edu and click the big "Create a site" button on the homepage. 
* Login with your PSU credentials.  
* Fill out the following fields:
  * Site Address refers to the URL for your site; whatever you enter will result in a URL like "http://sites.psu.edu/myawesomesite"\). Only lowercase letters and numbers are allowed. 
  * Site Title is the general name for your site; you probably want to enter the same thing you used for the Site Address, but you can call it whatever you want \(and you can change it later\). 
  * Privacy will determine if your site is promoted to search engine and public web listings \(this can also be changed later\). Choose whatever you like. 

Step Two

You should have received a confirmation screen with links to the site itself and the administration backend. If not, you can always just type your URL into your web browser \(e.g. "http://sites.psu.edu/myawesomesite"\).
