Most of us spend our whole days online, and as such there are _a lot_ of different tools for building websites. Some of these tools are simpler or more complex than others, and I think it's useful to understand what's out there, and try a variety of tools. Even the simple platforms that might not seem "professional" might prove useful when your friend needs to build a website in time for dinner.

We're going to get into the nitty gritty of how web content works, and just what the heck HTTP means, but first let's see what you can build with absolutely zero experience in the field of web design—you might be surprised.

There are a lot of "code-free" editors that try to make the process of web development as easy as making a Powerpoint presentation. Many of these tools are free, and some even run in your web browser. These visual editors hide the code involved in structuring a website and aim to let users design by simply dragging and dropping elements around the screen. If you think about it, programs like Adobe Photoshop or even your operating system also run on code, and have evolved sophisticated graphical user interfaces \(GUI\) to make things as intuitive as possible.

Some visual editors for making quick websites include: Weebly, Wix, Google Sites, Tilda, Carrd, and many more.

There are also blogging platforms like Wordpress and Tumblr that can function somewhat well as standalone sites.

These platforms are often where untrained individuals turn when they need to create a website, and while I don't particularly recommend using them for professional work, it's good to know what's out there—and you never know when you'll need to bang out a site in a couple hours or recommend a tool to someone less experienced. 

Most of these platforms will let you host a site using a subdomain of the service \(such as: "http://my-site-name.tumblr.com"\), and many have premium options for unique URL's and advanced customization. The other big player in this field is Squarespace, which only offers paid plans, but is also built around a visual editor for building sites.

We'll be returning to these visual editors in Exercise 1.
