Everyone should have created a Wordpress site in Exercise 2. We'll be using these personal research blogs to post writing responses throughout the semester. Each Lesson will include a prompt for a new blog post that will be due at a date specified in the course schedule.

After the due date for each blog post, students will be required to comment on each other's posts.

TBD SUBMISSION DETAILS

### Lesson 1 Blog Prompt

Read the following excerpt from Don Norman's _The Design of Everyday Things _\(1988, revised 2013\).

[Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things \(excerpt\)](/assets/readings/Norman_Design-of-Everyday-Things.pdf)

Don Norman is an influential designer and academic whose writing has been foundational to modern ideas of human-centered design \(HCD\). While not explicitly about web design, this reading introduces some useful terms for thinking about user interaction and visual design that will help frame the work we do in this course.

For this blog post, please provide a general reaction to the reading—possibly including close analysis of ideas, surprising facts, disagreements with the author, or comparisons to your own experiences.

In addition to a general response, please write about the "fundamental principles of interaction" identified in the reading:

* Affordance
* Signifier
* Mapping
* Feedback

For each of these terms, describe an example you have observed in either a physical or digital context, and what it reveals about user interaction. You can write about instances of "good design" or "bad design" — but don't write about the same examples provided in the text.
