Everyone should have created a Wordpress site in Exercise 2. We'll be using these personal research blogs to post writing responses throughout the semester. Each Lesson will include a prompt for a new blog post that will be due at a date specified in the course schedule.

### Lesson 1 Blog Prompt

Read the following excerpt from Don Norman's _The Design of Everyday Things _\(1988, revised 2013\).

[Don Norman, The Design of Everyday Things \(excerpt\)](/assets/readings/Norman_Design-of-Everyday-Things.pdf)

Don Norman is an influential designer and academic whose writing has been foundational to modern ideas of human-centered design \(HCD\). While not explicitly about web design, this reading introduces some useful terms for thinking about user interaction and visual design that will help frame the work we do in this course.

For this blog post, please provide a general reaction to the reading—possibly including close analysis of ideas, surprising facts, disagreements with the author, or comparisons to your own experiences.

In addition to a general response, please write about the "fundamental principles of interaction" identified in the reading:

* Affordance
* Signifier
* Mapping
* Feedback

For each of these terms, describe two examples: one in a physical, real-world context, and another in a website or app. Beyond describing the examples, explain what they reveal about the function or usability of the design. You can write about instances of "good design" or "bad design" — but don't write about the same examples provided in the reading.

For each term, include an image—4 images total \(or more\). Read the documentation about [formatting images](https://codex.wordpress.org/Inserting_Images_into_Posts_and_Pages) in Wordpress posts, paying attention to size and alignment to make them look good in your post. You can also [add a gallery](https://codex.wordpress.org/The_WordPress_Gallery) to show a grid of related images.

### Requirements

* Minimum 700 words
* 4+ images
* 2 examples for each of the four terms above. 

### Draft Submission

1. Publish blog posts on Wordpress
2. Post a screenshot in the relevant Open Studio assignment along with the URL to your post. 

### Peer Review

* Post comments on 3 of your classmates' submissions in Open Studio

### Revision

1. Revise your blog post according to feedback from your classmates.
2. Publish the updated blog post.
3. Post the URL for your blog post in the relevant Canvas assignment. 
4. Describe your revisions in a comment within the Canvas assignment.
