Imagine three different designs for your final site. Your first idea usually isn't your best one, so don't get too attached to anything. Try to come up with dramatically different layouts and styles for your website. See how it would look with vertical scrolling AND horizontal scrolling. Try out a dark background AND a light background. Organic AND geometric. If you have trouble thinking of a different approach, consider what the opposite of your current idea would be.

**For each design, create the following: **

* A brief written design statement 
* A rough wireframe - sketched out or designed in Illustrator. Label each of the main pages and mark how they are connected.
* Mood board \(at least five images\)
* Color palette \(5 colors\)
* Font Pair \(A header and body font\)
