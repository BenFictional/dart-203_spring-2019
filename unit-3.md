## The Design Process

This unit will focus on the development of a new website. We will use some of the same tools and methods from past lessons, but use a more robust design process to practice professional workflows. 

This new website will be a multi-page site that focuses more on usability and modern standardizations than the more experimental site we made in unit 2. 

We'll introduce some new tools and focus on brainstorming and iteration as key principles of web design.
