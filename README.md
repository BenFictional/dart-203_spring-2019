## Meet Glitch

Instead of editing files on your local computer, for this project, students will use the online coding app [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to write HTML and CSS in virtual files. This lets you easily share the project and code with other people and lets you host the files as a free website on the Glitch servers.

Glitch is an exiciting platform aiming to demystify web development and create space for wacky experiments. Check [Glitch on Twitter](https://twitter.com/glitch) for the latest news and projects from the global community. 

We'll be using Glitch for a couple assignments; for each one I'll share a link to a template project and you'll create a "remix" under your account. 

**Watch the following videos to learn about Glitch:**

I like the editor better with "dark" theme and "wrap text" switched on.
