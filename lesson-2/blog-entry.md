For this blog post, we're going to focus on the idea of grid design, as students produce their own grid-based designs for the landing page assignment. Please create a new blog post for your Wordpress blog based on the following prompt:

**Prompt: **As we've seen earlier in this lesson, the grid is a long-standing design technique for presenting all sorts of content. For each of the following, find an example to write about on your blog:

* 1. An example of **successful grid-based design** that you like.
  2. An example of successful layout design that **"breaks the grid"** by disrupting the traditional rules of grid design. 
  3. An example of layout design that you **don't like**. You must connect your analysis of the design to the idea of grid layout; it might do a poor job of following grid structure, or perhaps it presents an overly boring grid structure. You can describe other reasons that you dislike the design as well. 

**For each example, include:**

* One more more image
* Hyperlink to the site itself â€” do not paste in the full URL. Create a [hyperlink](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/beginners-guide-on-how-to-add-a-link-in-wordpress/) around a word or phrase.

Write a short overview of the website, publication, or image \(examples do not have to be digital\). 

* Identify the subject matter and function of the design.
* Describe the visual appearance. Be very descriptive and try to identify the key visual elements of the design. Describe the colors, fonts, composition, and other formal \(i.e. describing the form\) elements, and then write about the overall mood and style that they create.
* Explain why the design is successful or not.
* Analyze the design from the perspective of the designer. Why might they have made certain design choices? What were they thinking or trying to accomplish? 

Your examples can include websites, apps, video games, magazines, books, posters, album art, signs, or any other media that use grid layout.
