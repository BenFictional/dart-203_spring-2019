For this blog post, we're going to focus on the idea of grid design, as students produce their own grid-based designs for the landing page assignment. Please create a new blog post for your Wordpress blog based on the following prompt:

**Prompt: **As we've seen earlier in this lesson, the grid is a long-standing design technique for presenting all sorts of content. For each of the following, find an examples to write about on your blog:

* 1. An example of **successful grid-based design** that you like.
  2. An example of successful layout design that **"breaks the grid"** by disrupting the traditional rules of grid design. 
  3. An example of layout design that you **don't like**. You must connect your analysis of the design to the idea of grid layout; it might do a poor job of following grid structure, or perhaps it presents an overly boring grid structure. You can describe other reasons that you dislike the design as well. 

Include an image or screenshot for each of your examples, and write a short overview of the publication, its subject matter, and visual appearance. Be very descriptive and try to identify the key visual elements of the design. Describe the colors, fonts, composition, and other formal \(i.e. describing the form\) element, and then write about the overall mood and style that is created by the design.

Include your assessment of why the design is successful or unsuccessful. What makes it engaging \(or not\)? This could include aspects of usability or appearance.

This is an opportunity to do some light research and look for interesting examples of design; you might find websites or publications that directly inspire your assignment, but they don't have to be directly related.

Your examples can include websites, apps, video games, magazines, books, posters, album art, signs, or any other media that use grid layout.
