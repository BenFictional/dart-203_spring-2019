As mentioned on the Typography page, you should read the following excerpts from Butterick's Practical Typography:

* 1. [Typography in Ten Minutes ](http://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html)
  2. [Websites](http://practicaltypography.com/websites.html)

The second link goes into some detail about the history of web design, particularly how some of the standards of web typography resulted from technical limitations.

### Blog Prompt

Fo this lesson, students will research the history of web design, specifically focusing on the aesthetics of websites prior to the year 2000. 

**Your blog post should include:**

* Include screenshots or images of three web pages from before the year 2000. 
* For each one, write at least 200 words describing:
  * A visual description of the website \(colors, style, shapes, fonts, layout\).
  * Analysis of the overall effect of those visual elements, i.e. how would you feel using the site or simply looking at it?
  * The usability of the site compared to websites today
  * Any historical connections to technology, society, or art. 
  * Compared to contemporary websites, is there anything about the page that you like? 

Think of this writing assignment like a short piece of art criticism. Use descriptive language \(lots of adjectives\), and share your own unique perspective on your chosen specimens.
