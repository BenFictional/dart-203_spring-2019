HTML is text—only text—but the written word is also an essential part of the a finished website. Typography is important to all forms of design, but it's especially vital for web designers because so much of the content they deal with is text.

Video has become a big part of the online experience, but even videos are captioned now because people want to watch them silently on their phones. In an environment built around speed, text is still the fastest way to absorb information, and text also takes up much less virtual memory than images or video, meaning that websites relying on text will load faster.

As we start to work with HTML and the study the traditions of web design, it will be useful to look at some standard of typography and how they have evolved alongside digital technology.

### Basic Vocabulary

There are three main families of fonts, each with traditional uses and associations:

**Serif **fonts** **include small "feet" along the tops and bottoms of characters, designed to guide the reader's eye along each line of text. Serif fonts are generally used for body text \(i.e. extended paragraphs such as a news article or blog post\), and are usually considered old-fashioned or classical.

**Sans-serif **fonts don't have serifs, and therefore appear more minimal, clean, and modern. These fonts are more commonly used for headings because there's no need to guide the reader's eye along a brief title. Sans-serif fonts can be used for body text as well, and this is much more common in web design than in print.

**Monospace **fonts use the same width for every character \(i.e. letter\), and are most commonly used in coding \(such as writing HTML in Brackets\). You can use these fonts for actual content too, if you're looking for a old-school computer or typewriter aesthetic.

The **baseline** is a helpful visual reference when arranging text with other elements.
