After completing Exercise 1 and 2 for this lesson, you should have a basic understanding of HTML and CSS. This assignment will provide further experience designing with code, and connect with the subject of this lesson's blog entry.

### Objectives

* Apply visual styles to a ready-made HTML project. 
* Recreate the aesthetics and design trends of a specific period of web design.
* Imagine multiple design solutions for a single piece of content. 

### Get the Template Files

Download the sample HTML project from this GitHub repository.

1. Click the green "Clone or Download" button.
2. Choose "Download Zip"
3. Unzip the file on your computer by double-clicking. 
4. Copy the contents of the "lesson-2" folder to your local-directory folder, and place it inside your art203 subdirectory. 

The file structure should be: "../local-directory/art203/lesson-2/index.html"

The sample project includes two HTML files and a folder called "css" that contains two files: "styles-90s.css" and "styles-modern.css"

CSS properties can be included in the `<head>` section of a single html page, but it's common practice to place all the CSS in a separate file to keep things organized.

The "index.html" file contains a link to "style-90s.css" in the `<head>` sectionâ€”this imports the file and applies all the CSS values.

Open the HTML file in a web browser and take a look at the structure of the website and how it is defined in the code.

* There are extensive comments to help you find your way around \(comments will appear grey in Brackets\)
* "index-alt.html" is reserved for the end of the assignment, so ignore it at first. 
* The layout uses modern HTML5 declarations like `<header>` and a responsive two-column [Flexbox](https://internetingishard.com/html-and-css/flexbox/) layout in an effort to teach current standards.





### Using Brackets

You should use Brackets to edit the template files; just select Filer &gt;&gt;&gt; Open folder

Brackets has several features that will make your job easier. It automatically color-codes different properties to help you understand the code, and it offers prompts as you begin typing. For example, if I type `<div>` in an HTML file, it will automatically generate the closing `</div>` tag. Or if I type the letter "b" in a CSS file, it will suggest a variety of properties starting with that letter.

You should also try out the **Live Preview** mode by pressing the Lighting Bolt icon in the upper-right of the Brackets window. This opens a special web browser that shows a live preview of your files; it even changes dynamically as you edit the HTML or CSS. If you click on an HTML tag or a CSS selector the targeted area will be highlighted in the Live Preview browser, similar to how the web inspector works in Chrome.
