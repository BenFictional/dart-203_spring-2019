For the main assignment in this Lesson, students will make a simple landing page for their PASS web directory. In future lessons, we will upload additional websites to PASS, and this landing page will act as a home page of sorts.

In order to develop a final design, we will use Illustrator to create a 2D mockup of the final website, and then use that as a roadmap when creating the final landing page. Mockups typically focus on simulating user interaction \(buttons, pop-ups, links, etc.\) but since landing pages are so simple, you can think of your design largely as a 2D composition like a poster or a painting.

### Objectives

* Create a lively and unique design using only text.
* Practice working with a 12 column grid layout.
* Create a 2D mockup in Illustrator as a basis for a future web page.

### Requirements

The landing page should include a variety of text, arranged to create an interesting visual composition that welcomes users to your web space. The landing page should convey something about yourself, similar to the self-portrait site from Lesson 1, but only using text. Come up with a theme or visual concept to base your landing page around. Consider the use of color and font choice, as well as creative use of a grid layout.

**The page should include:**

* Your name
* A link to your Wordpress blog \(e.g. "My blog"\)
* Space to add links to future websites
* Additional text such as a:
  * Poem
  * Quote
  * Joke
  * Recipe
  * Description
  * Song lyrics
  * ???

### Illustrator Setup

Download this [template file](https://psu.box.com/s/ykklw5grg85wlu05vahf7b8l2xxtnc3q) to use for your mockup.

The Illustrator template includes **Guides** that you can use to align shapes and text to a 12 column grid. The guides appear as thin cyan lines. They won't appear in your finished artwork, and you can adjust their behavior as follows:

* Under View &gt;&gt;&gt; Guides, you can toggle guides on and off, or lock/unlock them.
* The keyboard shortcut for toggling guides is ⌘+; \(CTRL+; for Windows\).
* When guides are locked, you can't select them. Keep them locked for this assignment. 

### Adding Text

NOTE: There are two ways to create text with the Text tool \(T\):

* 1. **Click once to create Point Text** \(best for headers\). Resizing the text box will increase the font size. Hold shift to maintain proportion and avoid stretching your text. 
  2. **Click and drag to create Area Text** \(best for body text\). Resizing the text box will change the shape of the text box, and the text will flow within it, maintaining the same font-size. 

Select either type of text object with the Selection tool to change the color, size, font, etc. Look in the top menu bar or open the Character window \(Window &gt;&gt;&gt; Character\).

To bring up a full color picker, double click on the color swatch at the bottom of the lefthand toolbar.

### Fonts

Illustrator can access any fonts on your computer, but when we create the final website for this assignment, we will will need to supply any custom fonts besides the core [web-safe fonts](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp). In order to make that process as easy as possible....

# _Only use fonts from _[_Google Fonts_](https://fonts.google.com)_._

**How to download Google Fonts:** Click the + button to select one or more fonts. Then click the black bar to view your fonts, and click the download button. Double-click the downloaded font files to install them.

### Flexible Layout

Your landing page mockup should be **1280px x 1024px** — but web browsers can stretch to fit many different dimensions...

The HTML template we're going to use for the assignment handles this by arranging everything in rows and columns. Each row can contain up to 12 columns, but when the browser gets narrow, each column changes to a full 12-sections. This is pretty standard behavior for modern websites, but it will be helpful to keep in mind while designing your mockup.

**Remember: **You're designing on a grid of columns, but each column is contained within a row. Which means it will be tricky to make a big vertical column, while it will be easy to make a big horizontal row. Luckily we usually read text horizontally.

Landing pages are usually composed like a big rectangular painting, and they keep all the content on screen at once. In design terms, this is called keeping the content **above the fold**. It's a term inherited from newspaper design, but now refers to everything at the top of the page \(that you don't have to scroll to see\). This is traditionally the most valuable real-estate in a design, but many designers are challenging that rule by creating sites that [encourage scrolling as a act of discovery](http://iampaddy.com/lifebelow600/). 

If you want to create a tall design that users scroll through, you can resize your **Artboard** in Illustartor with the[ Artboard tool.](https://helpx.adobe.com/illustrator/using/using-multiple-artboards.html)
