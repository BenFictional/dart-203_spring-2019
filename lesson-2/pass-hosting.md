This page provides instructions of setting up [hosting with PSU](http://www.personal.psu.edu/). Remember, web hosting is essentially using a far-away computer to store files. This is essentially the same as hosting files on cloud services like Dropbox, only it's much more open-ended in terms of what you can upload.

You'll need to do this for Lesson 2 Exercise 2.

### Apply Now

Apply for server space with PSU at this [application page.](https://www.work.psu.edu/webspace/) It may take a day or two for your space to become active, so **do this part right now** even if you're not going to complete Exercise 2 immediately.

Student space will remain active during periods of continuous enrollment and for six months after graduation.

### Access your space online

Once you receive an email saying that your PASS space is active, you can access an online file manager here: [https://explorer.pass.psu.edu/](https://explorer.pass.psu.edu/)

You will see a few different folders listed in the white content box. The \[www\] is the public location where you'll want to upload files.

Double click \[www\] to open that folder—there should be a default "index.html" file in there already. Web browsers automatically look for a file called "index.html" when they navigate to an online server address.

Exercise 1 will go over how to upload a new file to this location.

**The public URL for your web space is:** "[http://personal.psu.edu/user123](http://personal.psu.edu/user123)" — but replace "user123" with your PSU username.

If you type that into your web browser, you'll be looking at the "index.html" file as rendered by your web browser.

### FTP Software

You can also use a standalone application to manage your web hosting. This is usually easier than using the interface provided in your web browser. There are many different File-Transfer-Protocol apps; some of the more popular ones are:

[Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) \(Mac/Win, free\)

[Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io) \(Mac/Win, free\)

[Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/)\(Mac, paid\)

We'll use Filezilla for the demo in Exercise 1 since it's open-source and easy to get started with.
