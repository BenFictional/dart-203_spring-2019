Before completing this exercise, make sure you have read through the previous pages from this lesson on HTML, CSS, and the infrastructure of the Internet.

### Objectives:

* Examine how CSS is used in real world websites
* Practice using a browser inspector 
* Remix found material into new forms

This is a quick exercise to explore what different CSS properties can do. We'll also be using some essential tools for web development.

### Requirements

[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) web browser â€” you can use a different one if you prefer, but Chrome has an easy-to-use web inspector. 

### Choose a website

You can try this exercise with a few websites, so don't worry too much about which one you choose. Choose a site with a variety of content. 

We'll use the [Penn State homepage](http://psu.edu) for the demo. 

Once you've pulled up a website, right click anywhere on the screen and choose "Inspect."
