For this exercise, students will create a written outline of their ideas for the final website, so make sure you have read the overview of the website requirements earlier in this lesson. Whatever the subject of your website is, students are expected to apply critical design research and assessment to the development process. 

This proposal focuses purely on functionality. The next exercise will begin to develop visual designs, but it is useful to begin by outlining the needs and goals of the project.

### Objectives

* Identify a compelling subject for your website \(fictional business or portfolio\)
* Describe the essential needs of your site and how you will address them in your designs. 
* Consider your development within the context of problem-solving and human-centered design. 

### Requirements

Submit a DOCX or PDF addressing the following points. You can write a separate paragraph for each of the four bullet points, or write a single essay-like statement. 

* **Identify a problem **
  * What is the central need that your website will fulfill? 
* **Target audience**
  * Who will use the website? What assumptions can you make on their habits, devices, browsers, or expectations? 
  * Feel free to talk to people you know or include statistics from outside research.
* **Required content**
  * What are the essential pieces of information your site will contain? 
  * List the different pages you will need to include, along with any important sections within those pages.
