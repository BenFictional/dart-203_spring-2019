In order to push our development skills beyond the mockups created in Unit 2, as students develop their final websites, we will create interactive prototypes that present more sophisticated simulations of the final product. Prototypes are a common asset for anyone making websites or apps, and even if you're not required to work with these tools, it can be a great way to impress clients or collaborators.

Prototypes are essentially the same as mockups we made in Illustrator, but allow users to click on links and navigate between pages. They can also incorporate animations, and effects.

### Objectives

* Create 2D artwork to accurately present designs multiple design ideas for a website.
* Arrange pages in a logical way.
* Add interactive links and transitions to simulate the final site. 

### Requirements

Choose two of your design ideas from Exercise 2, and for each of them:

* Create a 2D mockup in Illustrator for desktop screens \(1280px or 1920px wide\)
* Create an interactive prototype with InVision \(see below\)
* Submit public sharing links for your two prototypes.

### Introducing InVision

There are a variety of prototyping tools available to create interactive presentations of mockups, we'll go over how to use InVision, which is a popular online app for creating and sharing protoptypes. It also has a built-in mood board feature!

InVision offers free accounts, but they are limited to one active prototype at a time \(and we need four\). Luckily, they offer free upgrades to students for a fully-featured account.

**To get a free student account: **Go to InVision's [Education Signup page ](https://www.invisionapp.com/education-signup)and fill out your information, including the following education code: 56-73-13-19

Create a password and remember what it is; you'll use it to log in to the website to work on your prototypes.

Another option for making prototypes in Adobe's new Experience Design \(Xd\) application. It's still in beta, but you can download it form the Creative Cloud app if you want to try it out. The main difference between Adobe Xd and InVision is that you make the whole mockup and prototype in Adobe Xd.

### InVision Lynda Tutorials

You should be able to get by with the instructions below, but if you have any trouble, or want to learn more, you can check out the Lynda course [InVision for UX Design](https://www.lynda.com/InVision-tutorials/InVision-UX-Design/599633-2.html) \(it's pretty short\).

### InVision Workflow

#### **1.Create mockups in Illustrator**

In order to save time, students won't be required to create mobile layouts for this assignment. It's still a good idea to think about your designs with a mobile-first approach. As you create content sections, imagine how they might stretch to fit small screens.  

**Your desktop mockups should be 1280px wide.** Some templates recommend designing desktop layouts to be 1080px x 1920px, but most the content of most websites, maxes out around 1200px and additional browser area is usually just filled with empty space. Remember that web designers should design for all screen sizes, so 1280px is somewhat arbitrary, but helps keep things simple and consistent for our class. 

Once you create one page, you can duplicate the artboard and adjust the content for additional pages.  Remember to resize your artboards with the Artboard tool to accommodate  the content for each page. "Tall" pages with large height values will be scrollable when we import them into InVision.

Rename each artboard from "Artboard 1" to "home-page" or something to help you identify each page.

#### **2. Export as PNG**

Use the "Export for Screens" option to export each artboard as a separate PNG file. Make sure to save them somewhere sensible and stay organized. ![](/assets/lesson-5/illustrator-page-export.png)

#### **3. Create InVision Project**

1. Click the pink "+" button to create a new project.
2. Select "Prototype." 
3. Select "Website."

#### **4. Upload PNG files.**

Select all your image files and drag them into InVision when prompted to.

#### **5. Add Hotspots**

1. Click on any of your page thumbnails in InVision, and select "View screen"
2. From the bottom menu, select "Build Mode" 
3. Click and drag anywhere on the screen to create **hotspots**—these will be clickable areas that act as links in the finished prototype. 
4. For each hotspot, select a destination page from the menu.

To save time, you can create **templates** while in Build mode. When adding a hotspot, you can check "Include hotspot in template"—and then when you open a new page, you an select a template from the top menu and the hotspots will be inserted automatically. This is best used for navigation menus, where the location of the links stays the same on each page.

#### 6. Get a public link

When you've finished adding hotspots for all your pages in a layout, click the "Share" button in the lower right, and then click "public share link" to get a URL. You will submit this URL for each of your four layouts as part of the assignment.

### Open Studio Submission

You should end up with two functional prototypes.

For each prototype, submit a screenshot of the home page to Open Studio along with a public sharing link to view the prototype online.

### Canvas Submission

After peer review and revisions, submit the following to Canvas:

* Project files for mockups
  * From Illustrator: File &gt;&gt;&gt; Package
  * Zip the exported folder for uploading
* Two public sharing links for the prototypes.
* Written Design Summary \(see template\) for both designs. You can combine your thoughts on the two designs or write two separate summaries.
