In order to push our development skills beyond the mockups created in Unit 2, as students develop their final websites, we will create interactive prototypes that present more sophisticated simulations of the final product. Prototypes are a common asset for anyone making websites or apps, and even if you're not required to work with these tools, it can be a great way to impress clients or collaborators.

Prototypes are essentially the same as mockups we made in Illustrator, but allow users to click on links and navigate between pages. They can also incorporate animations, and effects.

### Objectives

* Create 2D artwork to accurately present designs multiple design ideas for a website.
* Arrange pages in a logical way.
* Add interactive links and transitions to simulate the final site. 

### Requirements

Choose two of your design ideas from Exercise 2, and for each of them:

* Design a mobile and desktop layout in Adobe Illustrator, including multiple pages.
* Import the page mockups into InVision and add interactive links
* Publish the prototype online using InVision's website.
