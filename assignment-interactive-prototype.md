In order to push our development skills beyond the mockups created in Unit 2, as students develop their final websites, we will create interactive prototypes that present more sophisticated simulations of the final product. Prototypes are a common asset for anyone making websites or apps, and even if you're not required to work with these tools, it can be a great way to impress clients or collaborators.

Prototypes are essentially the same as mockups we made in Illustrator, but allow users to click on links and navigate between pages. They can also incorporate animations, and effects.

### Objectives

* Create 2D artwork to accurately present designs multiple design ideas for a website.
* Arrange pages in a logical way.
* Add interactive links and transitions to simulate the final site. 

### Requirements

Choose two of your design ideas from Exercise 2, and for each of them:

* Design a mobile and desktop layout in Illustrator
* Create an interactive prototype with Invision \(see below\)
* Submit public sharing links for your four prototypes \(mobile and desktop layouts for two different designs\)

### Introducing InVision

There are a variety of prototyping tools available to create interactive presentations of mockups, we'll go over how to use InVision, which is a popular online app for creating and sharing protoptypes. It also has a built-in mood board feature!

InVision offers free accounts, but they are limited to one active prototype at a time \(and we need four\). Luckily, they offer free upgrades to students for a fully-featured account. 

**To get a free student account: **Go to InVision's [Education Signup page ](https://www.invisionapp.com/education-signup)and fill out your information, including the following education code: 56-73-13-19 Â 

Create a password and remember what it is; you'll use it to log in to the website to work on your prototypes.

### Workflow

Create mockups in Illustrator

You should follow the same format used for previous mockups. Create a mobile layout that is

#### Adobe Experience Design

### Open Studio Submission

You should end up with four separate prototypes:

* Design One \(mobile\)
* Design One \(desktop\)
* Design Two \(mobile\)
* Design Two \(desktop\)

For each of the four prototypes, submit a screenshot of one page to Open Studio along with a public sharing link to view the prototype online.

### Canvas Submission

After peer review and revisions, submit the following to Canvas:

* Project files for mockups
  * If using Adobe XD, zip your entire project folder containing any image assets. 
  * If using InVision, you will have made mockups in Illustrator, so export a packaged Illustrator folder and zip that to submit. 
* Four public sharing links for the prototypes.
* Written Design Summary \(see template\)
