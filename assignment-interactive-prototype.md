In order to push our development skills beyond the mockups created in Unit 2, as students develop their final websites, we will create interactive prototypes that present more sophisticated simulations of the final product. Prototypes are a common asset for anyone making websites or apps, and even if you're not required to work with these tools, it can be a great way to impress clients or collaborators.

Prototypes are essentially the same as mockups we made in Illustrator, but allow users to click on links and navigate between pages. They can also incorporate animations, and effects.

### Objectives

* Create 2D artwork to accurately present designs multiple design ideas for a website.
* Arrange pages in a logical way.
* Add interactive links and transitions to simulate the final site. 

### Requirements

Choose two of your design ideas from Exercise 2, and for each of them:

* Design a mobile and desktop layout 
* Create an interactive prototype with either Adobe Experience Design or Invision \(see below\)
* Submit public sharing links for your four prototypes \(mobile and desktop layouts for two different designs\)

### Choose a Prototype Platform

#### InVision

...

#### Adobe Experience Design

...

### Open Studio Submission

You should end up with four separate prototypes:

* Design One \(mobile\)
* Design One \(desktop\)
* Design Two \(mobile\)
* Design Two \(desktop\)

For each of the four prototypes, submit a screenshot of one page to Open Studio along with a public sharing link to view the prototype online.

### Canvas Submission

After peer review and revisions, submit the following to Canvas:

* Project files for mockups
  * If using Adobe XD, zip your entire project folder containing any image assets. 
  * If using InVision, you will have made mockups in Illustrator, so export a packaged Illustrator folder and zip that to submit. 
* Four public sharing links for the prototypes.
* Written Design Summary \(see template\)
